// Unfortunately we need to define a way to update arrays to remain compatible with Vue 2 (due to IE11).
// This will become obsolete as soon as DWC is upgraded to Vue 3, but that isn't going to happen anytime soon.
// Until then a Vue 2 user would have to call something like this on initialization to work around this limitation:
// globalThis._duetModelSetArray = (array, index, value) => Vue.set(array, index, value);
// or in TypeScript
// (globalThis as any)._duetModelSetArray = (array: object, index: string | number, value: any) => Vue.set(array, index, value);
